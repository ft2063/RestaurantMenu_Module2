# RestaurantMenu_Module2
This is my first small css project! it features a responsive grid framework for displaying a restaurant menu. This means the web page should fit on screens with different sizes. This project is required for the completion of the course HTML by , CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers taught by Yaakov Chaikin, on Coursera (Johns Hopkins University)
